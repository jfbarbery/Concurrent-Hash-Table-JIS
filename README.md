# Concurrent-Hash-Table-JIS
A group project for an Operating Systems class at UCF,
where we will implement an concurrent hash table,
that allows multi-threaded access to the hash table.

How to run the program:
After cloning the repo (or downloading source code manually),
simply run "make" and ./chash

Developers note:
If you want to test different commands.txt text files, swap them out in dev/
Running "make test" will compile and run the program with the "commands.txt" file in dev/
